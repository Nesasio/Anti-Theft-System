# Vehicle Theft Detection System
An anti theft system for vehicles, especially cars, developed using Arduino. This system is a prototype smart lock for vehicles
which can track the location of the vehicle in real time and can jam the ignition on command.

## Components
The major components used are:
| S.No. | Component                                |
| :---- | :--------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Arduino Mega 2560                        |
| 2     | GPS Module                               |
| 3     | SMCOM SIM900A GSM Module                 |
| 4     | 16x2 LCD Display                         |
| 5     | Membrane Keypad                          |
| 6     | Relay Module                             |

## Hardware Simulation
The component testing and simulation of individual component and the prototype circuit was done using
[Proteus Design Suite](https://www.labcenter.com/).
